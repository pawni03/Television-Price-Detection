# Television Prices Prediction
## Predicting Television prices using machine learning process using R programming
The Television Prices Prediction project is a data science project implemented in R programming language, aimed at developing a predictive model to forecast the prices of televisions based on various features and attributes. This project utilizes machine learning algorithms and statistical techniques to analyze historical data on television sales and characteristics, and to build a model capable of predicting future prices.

**Basic understanding of code**
* Collect historical data on television sales, including features such as ram, speed, screen etc
* Price is the continous data (dependable varibale)
* Perform all necessary Data Cleaning - remove/fill missing values, change data types
* Find correlation between attributes - remove non correlated attributes(columns)
* Build and train the model on the currect existing prices along with other attributes
* Using the model find the predicted price values of the television

**Dependencies**
* R Programming Language
* Libraries: corrr, dplyr, caTools

**Data Sources**
* Historical sales data from retailers or online platforms
* Publicly available datasets on television specifications and prices
